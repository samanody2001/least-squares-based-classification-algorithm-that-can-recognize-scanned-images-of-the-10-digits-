# least-squares-based-classification-algorithm-that-can-recognize-scanned-images-of-the-10-digits
A multiple least squares-based classification algorithm that can recognize scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9). There are two folders: “Train” and “Test”. The “Train” folder contains 240 images for each digit, while the “Test” folder contains 20 images for each digit. The images in the “Train” folder should be used to train a classifier.The folder contains a file named “Training Labels.txt” which includes the labels of the 2400 images in order. After the classifiers trained, I tested
each classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder. The folder also contains a text file named “Test
Labels.txt” which include the labels of the 200 images in order.
